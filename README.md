## Introduction

"Who Killed Me" is an online forum dedicated to people pointing out when they have lost to a cheater in a video game. If the user can upload a YouTube video, they can create a post on the site, fill out some details about the incident, and share it with the community. Other users can then view the post, comment on it, and vote on whether they believe the report is valid.

The site also has a "News" section, where users can read articles about cheating in video games, updates on anti-cheat measures, and other related topics. These news articles are controlled and edited solely by site staff.

The platform was created in Django `6.0.1`, and built with Python `3.12.10`.
